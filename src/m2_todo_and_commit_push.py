#   This line is a COMMENT -- a note to human readers of this file.
#   When the Python interpreter RUNS (i.e. EXECUTES) a program, it ignores
#   everything from a  #  (hash) mark to the end of the line with the  #  mark.
#
#   We call files that have Python code in them MODULES.
#   Line 15 of this module (look at it now) prints (displays) the STRING
#      Hello, World
#   on the Run window.
#
#   Anything surrounded by quote marks (single or double) is a STRING.
#
###############################################################################
print('Hello, World')

# TODO: 1.
#   (Yes, that means for YOU to DO things per these instructions:)
#
#   Run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window
#   and selecting
#        Run 'name of file'
#   Or, use the keyboard shortcut:  Control + Shift + Function-F10.
#
#   After running, find the Run window and confirm that
#        Hello, World
#   did indeed get printed (displayed) on that window.

# TODO: 2.
#   Notice the small horizontal BLUE bars on the scrollbar-like thing
#   on the right.  Each blue bar indicates a thing TO-DO in this module.
#
#     a. You can use the blue bars to go from one TO-DO to the next
#        by clicking on the blue bars.  ** Try that now. **
#
#     b. When you have completed a TO-DO, you should change the word
#          _TODO_      (ignore the underscores on this line)
#        to
#          DONE
#        Try it now on line 19 above, and note that its blue bar on the
#        scrollbar-like thing to the right goes away soon thereafter.
#
#   If you change each _TODO_ to DONE like this, you can tell when you
#   have finished all the exercises in a module -- there will be no
#   blue bars left on the scrollbar-like thing to the right.
#
#   You have now completed _TODO_ #2, so change its _TODO_ on line 35 to DONE
#   (and likewise for all forthcoming TODOs in this course).

# TODO: 3.
#   Add another   print   statement below this comment.
#   It should print any string that you want (but keep it polite and G-rated!)
#
#   Test your code by re-running this module, either by proceeding
#   as you did when you ran this module the first time,
#   or by pressing the green rightward-pointing triangle
#   that is the "Play" button on the toolbar at the top of this window.
#   Look at the  Run  window to be sure that your string printed as expected.

# TODO: 4.
#   Add yet another   print   statement, putting it below this comment.
#   This one should print the *product* of 3,607 and 34,227.
#   Let the computer do the arithmetic for you (no calculators!).
#   You do NOT have to use strings for this, so no quotation marks!
#
#   TEST your code by re-running this module, then asking someone
#   whom you trust:
#      What number did your   print   display for this TO-DO?
#   (HINT: It is an INTERESTING number.)  Get help if your value is wrong.

# TODO: 5.
#   Look at the list of files in the Project window (to the left).
#   Note that this file:
#      m2_todo_and_commit_push.py
#   is now displayed in BLUE.
#
#   The BLUE font color means that you have made changes to this file which
#   have not yet been COMMITTED to version control and PUSHED to the cloud.
#
#   COMMIT and PUSH your work by:
#     1. Select   VCS   from the menu bar (above).
#     2. Choose  Commit  from the pull-down menu that appears.
#     3. In the  Commit Changes  window that pops up,
#        press the   Commit and Push   button.
#           (Note: If you see only a Commit button:
#              - HOVER over the  Commit  button
#                (in the lower-right corner of the window)
#              - CLICK on  Commit and Push.)
#
#   COMMIT adds the changed work to the version control system
#   on your COMPUTER.  PUSH adds the changed work into your Github
#   repository in the "cloud".
#
#   PyCharm forces you to add a  Commit  message intended to describe
#   your work to teammates, but until your team project use   Done
#   or whatever you want for the  Commit  message.
#
#   Always PUSH (in addition to the COMMIT) so that your work
#   is backed-up in the cloud.  If you COMMIT but forget to PUSH,
#   you can subsequently do the PUSH by:
#      VCS ~ Git ~ Push...
#
#   Oh, one more thing:
#     Do you have any blue bars on the scrollbar-like thing to the
#     right?  If so, click on each blue bar and change its _TODO_ to
#     DONE and then run the module (to make sure you didn't break
#     anything) and COMMIT-and-PUSH again.
#
#   You can COMMIT-and-PUSH as often as you like.
#   DO IT FREQUENTLY; AT LEAST once per module.
