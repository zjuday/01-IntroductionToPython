# DONE: 1.
#   Read the 2 lines of code ABOVE this _TODO_.  That code:
#     1. Computes 2 raised to the 5th power,
#          yielding the object that is the integer 32.
#     2. Makes the name   answer   refer to that object.
#     3. Looks up the object to which the name   answer  refers (i.e., 32).
#     4. Multiplies that object (32) by 100
#          (hence computing the object that is the integer 3,200).
#     5. Prints the newly-computed object.  (It prints WITHOUT the comma.)
#
#   Make sure that you understand that those two lines do the above,
#     ** ASKING QUESTIONS AS NEEDED. **
#   Once you completely understand the above, run this module,
#   confirming that it prints 3200.  Then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 2.
#   Immediately below this _TODO_, write code that:
#     - Computes 77 plus the cosine of 2.75.
#         HINT: You will need to import the   math  module (library).
#     - Stores that computed value using a name of your own choosing.
#     - Prints the square root of that computed value.
#   Run your code (fix errors as needed), then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 3.
#   Immediately below this _TODO_, write code that computes and prints:
#      the square root of ((41 * 88) + (4 * the cosine of 2))
#   Use as few or as many intermediate names as you feel appropriate.
#   Run your code (fix errors as needed), then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 4.
#   Immediately below this _TODO_,
#   write code that computes the square root of 2 in two ways:
#     - By using the   math.sqrt   function.
#     - By raising 2 to the 0.5 power (using   **   for exponentiation).
#   Print both of the expressions that you write.
#   Run your code (fix errors as needed), then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 5.
#   Every object has a TYPE and a VALUE.  For example,
#   for the object that is computed by  math.sqrt(2):
#      Its TYPE is float  (which is shorthand for "floating point number").
#      Its VALUE is (approximately) 1.4142135623730951.
#
#   The TYPE of an object is important because it determines:
#      -- what the object KNOWS, and
#      -- what the object can DO.
#
#   The   type   function returns the TYPE of its argument.  For example,
#       type(3.14)    returns the CLASS (synonym for TYPE) 'float'
#   and so the code:
#       print(type(3.14))
#   will print     <class 'float'>
#   Try it now!
#   (Just write   print(type(3.14))   below this _TODO_ and run the program.)
#
#   Now go through the BLAH objects listed below, one by one.  For each:
#      1. Try to GUESS its TYPE.
#      2. Then write code of the form   print(type(BLAH)).
#      3. THen RUN the code to LEARN its TYPE.

#       "hello"
#       'hello'
#       'a b c'
#       3 + 3
#       "3" + "3"
#       2 ** 100
#       2.0 ** 100
#       math.sin(8)
#       math.sin
#       print
#       math
#       'math'
#
# After you have written and run the code to learn the TYPE
# of each of the above, change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 6.
#   Ensure that no blue bars on the scrollbar-thing to the right remain.
#   Run one more time to be sure that all is still OK.
#
#   Then COMMIT-and-PUSH your work as before:
#     1. Select   VCS   from the menu bar (above).
#     2. Choose  Commit  from the pull-down menu that appears.
#     3. In the  Commit Changes  window that pops up,
#        press the   Commit and Push   button.
#           (Note: If you see only a Commit button:
#              - HOVER over the  Commit  button
#                (in the lower-right corner of the window)
#              - CLICK on  Commit and Push.)
#
#   You can COMMIT-and-PUSH as often as you like.
#   DO IT FREQUENTLY; AT LEAST once per module.
